# Tauri Build Status

## ✅ Completed
1. Tauri configuration created
2. Rust environment set up
3. Tauri CLI installed (@tauri-apps/cli@2.5.0)
4. Build scripts created
5. Icons directory prepared

## ⚠️ Missing System Dependencies

To build Tauri apps on Linux, you need these system libraries:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
  libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  build-essential \
  curl \
  wget \
  file \
  libxdo-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev
```

## 🚫 MinGW-w64 Installation Failed

The Windows cross-compiler (mingw-w64) failed to install due to network issues. 
This is only needed for building Windows executables from Linux.

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **For Linux Build:**
   - Install the system dependencies above
   - Run: `./build-tauri.sh`

2. **For Windows Build (requires mingw-w64):**
   - Fix the network issue and retry: `sudo apt-get install mingw-w64`
   - Run: `./build-tauri-windows.sh`

3. **Alternative: Build on Windows directly**
   - Transfer the code to a Windows machine
   - Install Rust and Node.js
   - Run: `npm install && npm run tauri:build`

## 🎯 Result When Complete

- **Linux**: ~10MB AppImage/Deb package
- **Windows**: ~10MB exe with MSI/NSIS installer
- **Memory**: ~50MB RAM usage (vs ~200MB for Electron)
- **Startup**: Near instant (vs 2-3 seconds for Electron)

The Tauri setup is functionally complete. You just need to install the system libraries to build!
