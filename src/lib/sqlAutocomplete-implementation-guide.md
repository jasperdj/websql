# SQL Autocomplete Implementation Guide

## Current Implementation (Phase 1) âœ…

### Features Implemented:
1. **Table Name Suggestions**
   - After `FROM`, `JOIN`, `INTO`, `UPDATE` keywords
   - Shows all user tables (excludes system tables)

2. **Column Name Suggestions**
   - After `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `GROUP BY` keywords
   - Detects table from `FROM` clause
   - Shows column type as detail

3. **SQL Keyword Suggestions**
   - Common SQL keywords with fuzzy matching
   - Fallback when no context-specific suggestions

4. **Hover Information**
   - Hover over table names to see all columns and types

5. **Auto-refresh Schema**
   - Refreshes on component mount
   - Refreshes when window regains focus

## Phase 2 - Planned Enhancements

### 1. **Table Alias Support**
```sql
-- Support for: FROM users u
-- Should suggest: u.id, u.name, etc.
```

### 2. **Multi-Table Context**
```sql
-- Support for JOINs
SELECT u.name, p.title 
FROM users u 
JOIN posts p ON u.id = p.user_id
-- Should suggest columns from both tables with prefixes
```

### 3. **Function Suggestions**
- Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`
- String functions: `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, `LENGTH()`, etc.
- Date functions based on DuckDB's functions

### 4. **Smart Filtering**
- Filter columns based on WHERE clause context
- Suggest only numeric columns after `SUM(`, `AVG(`
- Suggest only date columns for date functions

### 5. **Snippet Support**
```sql
-- Common patterns as snippets
SELECT ${1:columns} FROM ${2:table} WHERE ${3:condition}
```

## Phase 3 - Advanced Features

### 1. **Query History Integration**
- Suggest from previously executed queries
- Learn common patterns

### 2. **Performance Optimization**
- Lazy load large schemas
- Implement virtual scrolling for suggestions
- Cache parsed query AST

### 3. **Type-aware Suggestions**
- Suggest appropriate operators based on column type
- Validate JOIN conditions

### 4. **CTE and Subquery Support**
```sql
WITH user_stats AS (
  SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) as post_count
  FROM posts
  GROUP BY user_id
)
-- Should understand user_stats as a virtual table
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Trigger Autocomplete**: Type after SQL keywords or press `Ctrl+Space`
2. **View Table Schema**: Hover over any table name
3. **Quick Column Selection**: Type table prefix (e.g., `u.`) for filtered suggestions

## Technical Notes

- Uses Monaco Editor's completion API
- Schema cached in memory for performance
- Implements both `CompletionItemProvider` and `HoverProvider`
- Context detection via regex pattern matching
